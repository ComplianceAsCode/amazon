  narrative: 'IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control
    of permissions for users under 18F AWS Account to access services, buckets or
    objects. With IAM policies, 18F only grant users within its own AWS account permission
    to access its Amazon resources.

    18F AWS IAM policies are defined to grant only the required access for 18F staff
    necessary to perform their functions. 18F defines least privilege access to each
    user, group or role.

    Security functions within the AWS infrastructure are explicitly defined within
    IAM to include read-only permissions for any user functions.

    18F incorporate running the IAM Policy Simulator to test policies for least privilege
    access for users and groups.
